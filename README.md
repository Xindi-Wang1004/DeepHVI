Hello, this is the code collection of DeepHVI.
If you want to reproduce the process in the article, you can install the environment according to the requirements.txt first, and then run the sh_esm2_sv_esm2_SH_SV_pretrain.py for training. You can replace it with your own dataset here.After this script is completed, the corresponding weight file will be generated in the model/model_dict folder. If it is multi-epochs training, please select the file name with the smallest loss and fill it in sh_esm2_sv_esm2_SH_SV_reg_prediction.py to conduct the binary classification scoring experiment.
We also provide two files similarity_input_human.py and similarity_input_virus.py to execute the sequence generation task. "input_human" means inputting human sequences and returning the virus sequence with the highest cosine similarity; "input_virus" means inputting virus sequences and returning the human sequence with the highest cosine similarity. The code corresponding to the case of the novel coronavirus in the article is also in the similarity_input_virus.py with the function of task2_analysis.
Best wishes!
